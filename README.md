# EMF-Detector
I have developed an EMF detector that is cost-effective and easy to use. It can detect the presence and level of Electro-Magnetic Fields (EMF) around us. Additionally, it can display different types of EM waves, (ex: Radio waves, Microwaves, and Ultra-Violet waves etc) depending upon intensity and wavelength of EM waves.
